In sixth form, I had my first large-scale programing project with the open ended brief of 'create a programme which solves a problem'. I opted to create a maths based video game targeted at primary school students, called 'Goblins Can't count', to encourege learning through games. This project was created in the Unity game engine with custom assets and scripts. This project was my first time using Unity and any of the C programing languages (C# for unity) which is why you will also find teh code for Flappy Bird. This project was created using a video toutorial from Game Makers Toolkit (REF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM), once again with my own assets. I thoroughly emjoyed creating bith of these projects, especially when it came to the asset design, project planning and development of multiple scripts which came together to form the completed project.
