Welcome to my Repository!
Here you will be able to find programing projects I have completed throughout my time in Sixth form and at the University of Greenwich Studying Cyber Security and digital forensics. In this read me file, you will find some context surrounding each of the projects. 

YEAR 2:
As of right now, I have not completed any programing projects within my second year at UOG. Instead we have been focused on networking and information security. 

YEAR 1:
In year 1, we completed 3 modules which consosted of programoing projects of differing sizes; Paradigms of programing, Algorythms and compilers. 

In Paradigms of programing, we compelted two projects in Python and Scheme respectively. The python project me with cerating a text based family tree that could return a veriaty of predetermined requests such as the imediate family of one family member or the average age of all family members through a user interface. The Sceme project folloed the same brief, however, we did not have the requirement of developing a user interface.

In our algorythms module, we had one project to create an algorythms which took a binary string and broke it down into each of its possible substrings. The algorythm then went through the list of substrings to identify all the prime numbers and order them in accending order, only returning the smallest and largest 3 primes. The project required two samples and an optimesd solution. I contributed on sample solution 1 and the optimesd which is what you will find in this repository. 

Finally in the compilers module, we spent our time learning how to programe in linux and utilise console commands. Along with this we also spent some time exerimenting with bison, using it to create a boolean calculator.  

Sixth Form:
In sixth form, I had my first large-scale programing project with the open ended brief of 'create a programme which solves a problem'. I opted to create a maths based video game targeted at primary school students, called 'Goblins Can't count', to encourege learning through games. This project was created in the Unity game engine with custom assets and scripts. This project was my first time using Unity and any of the C programing languages (C# for unity) which is why you will also find teh code for Flappy Bird. This project was created using a video toutorial from Game Makers Toolkit (REF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM), once again with my own assets. I thoroughly emjoyed creating bith of these projects, especially when it came to the asset design, project planning and development of multiple scripts which came together to form the completed project.
