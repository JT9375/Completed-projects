In year 1, we completed 3 modules which consosted of programoing projects of differing sizes; Paradigms of programing, Algorythms and compilers. 

In Paradigms of programing, we compelted two projects in Python and Scheme respectively. The python project me with cerating a text based family tree that could return a veriaty of predetermined requests such as the imediate family of one family member or the average age of all family members through a user interface. The Sceme project folloed the same brief, however, we did not have the requirement of developing a user interface.

In our algorythms module, we had one project to create an algorythms which took a binary string and broke it down into each of its possible substrings. The algorythm then went through the list of substrings to identify all the prime numbers and order them in accending order, only returning the smallest and largest 3 primes. The project required two samples and an optimesd solution. I contributed on sample solution 1 and the optimesd which is what you will find in this repository. 

Finally in the compilers module, we spent our time learning how to programe in linux and utilise console commands. Along with this we also spent some time exerimenting with bison, using it to create a boolean calculator.
